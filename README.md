# Song-Genre-Predictor
Machine learning approach to predict a song's genre based on its lyrics.
This is code written to predict a given song's genre given its lyric data. Songs scraped using the lyric genius API. 
The scraped and cleaned lyrics are provided in a CSV file, so cleaning/scraping does not need to take place. PySpark was used 
to speed up the scraping and cleaning process. PDF file for write up on the predictions is available to provide further description of the process.
